# Literature Review of Malware AI

If you have read a paper, do the following:
- Find a unique name for the paper. This can be in terms of the novel algorithm proposed or the name of the main article author
  - Eg if the paper pertains to W-Net, leave it as W-Net
  - Else if the name of the author is Qizhe Xie, name the paper Xie et al, or if there’s co-authors (eg Qizhe Xie, Minh-Thang Luong) and there already exists a paper named Xie et al, go with Xie, Luong et al.
  - If none of these conditions are unique, then just name the project after the paper
- Place the paper under this alias in the “papers” directory
- Place any insights in a markdown file named for the alias in the “insights” directory
- If you find something useful that is generalistic, you can also put a brief summary (I cannot emphasize this enough) in the “Summary of our Literature Review” document.
